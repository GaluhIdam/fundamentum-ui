<h1>Breadcrumbs</h1>
<p>
  FuiBreadcrumbs let the user track their progress within and back out of a UX
  flow and work well when used in combination with FuiPageHeader. They are meant
  to be used at lower page level flows, while FuiHeaderBreadcrumbs should be
  used for application-wide navigation.

<div class="container">
  <fui-breadcrumb
    [data]="links"
    (onChangeBreadcrumb)="changeBread($event)"
  ></fui-breadcrumb>
</div>
