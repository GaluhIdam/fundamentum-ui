<h1>File picker</h1>
<p>
  FuiFilePicker is a stylized, but generic HTML {{"<"}}input type="file" /> tag. It
  supports drag and drop as well as on click style selection of files. The
  example below shows how to grab the files using the FileList API(opens in a
  new tab or window). Like other form elements, you can wrap it in a FuiFormRow
  to apply a label.

<fui-field-filepicker
  [files]="myFile"
  (filesSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
></fui-field-filepicker>
