</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Token management and storage:</strong> Provides methods to securely
    store and retrieve tokens (access, ID, and refresh tokens) using various
    storage mechanisms such as local storage, session storage, or cookies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Token exchange:</strong> Facilitates the exchange of authorization
    codes for tokens by interacting with OIDC token endpoints, ensuring secure
    authentication and authorization processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cryptographic operations:</strong> Generates nonces, code verifiers,
    and code challenges required for OIDC authentication flows, ensuring
    cryptographic security in authentication processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage management:</strong> Offers methods to set, get, and delete
    data from local storage, session storage, and cookies, providing flexible
    and secure storage options for OIDC-related data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revocation:</strong> Supports revoking tokens and clearing storage
    for logout functionality, ensuring secure logout and session management for
    users.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin: 50px 0px 0px 0px">Data Transfer Objects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ConfigDTO:</strong> Data transfer object for authentication
    configuration, providing a structured way to pass authentication
    configuration parameters to OIDC services.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>WellKnownEndPointDTO:</strong> Data transfer object for OIDC
    well-known endpoints, offering a standardized format for representing OIDC
    endpoint information and ensuring interoperability with OIDC-compliant
    systems.
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 50px 0px 0px 0px">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Both services are designed to work seamlessly with
  Angular applications and abstract complex OIDC-related tasks to simplify OIDC
  integration and authentication processes.
